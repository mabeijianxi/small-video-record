=head1 NAME

ffmpeg-codecs - FFmpeg codecs

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This document describes the codecs (decoders and encoders) provided by
the libavcodec library.




=head1 CODEC OPTIONS


libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.

Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVCodecContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follow:


=over 4


=item B<b> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio,video>B<)>

Set bitrate in bits/s. Default value is 200K.


=item B<ab> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio>B<)>

Set audio bitrate (in bits/s). Default value is 128K.


=item B<bt> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,video>B<)>

Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the
target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on quality.


=item B<flags> I<flags> B<(>I<decoding/encoding,audio,video,subtitles>B<)>

Set generic flags.

Possible values:

=over 4

=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<palette>

Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps. When stored in VobSub, the
palette is normally specified in the index file; in Matroska, the palette is
stored in the codec extra-data in the same format as in VobSub. In DVDs, the
palette is stored in the IFO file, and therefore not available when reading
from dumped VOB files.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal

Default value is *.

=item B<txt_chop_top>

Discards the top teletext line. Default value is 1.

=item B<txt_format>

Specifies the format of the decoded subtitles. The teletext decoder is capable
of decoding the teletext pages to bitmaps or to simple text, you should use
"bitmap" for teletext pages, because certain graphics and colors cannot be
expressed in simple text. You might use "text" for teletext based subtitles if
your application can handle simple text based subtitles. Default value is
bitmap.

=item B<txt_left>

=head1 AUDIO ENCODERS


A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.



=head2 aac


Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is the default AAC encoder, natively implemented into FFmpeg. Its
quality is on par or better than libfdk_aac at the default bitrate of 128kbps.
This encoder also implements more options, profiles and samplerates than
other encoders (with only the AAC-HE profile pending to be implemented) so this
encoder has become the default and is the recommended choice.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<b>

Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode. If this option is unspecified it is set to 128kbps.


=item B<q>

Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool. For library interface users, use
B<global_quality>.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency. If unspecified will allow the encoder to dynamically
adjust the cutoff to improve clarity on low bitrates.


=item B<aac_coder>

Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<twoloop>

Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.  Will tune
itself based on whether B<aac_is>, B<aac_ms> and B<aac_pns>
are enabled.
This is the default choice for a coder.


=item B<anmr>

Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This is an experimental coder which currently produces a lower quality, is more
unstable and is slower than the default twoloop coder but has potential.
Currently has no support for the B<aac_is> or B<aac_pns> options.
Not currently recommended.


=item B<fast>

Constant quantizer method.

This method sets a constant quantizer for all bands. This is the fastest of all
the methods and has no rate control or support for B<aac_is> or
B<aac_pns>.
Not recommended.


=back



=item B<aac_ms>

Sets mid/side coding mode. The default value of "auto" will automatically use
M/S with bands which will benefit from such coding. Can be forced for all bands
using the value "enable", which is mainly useful for debugging or disabled using
"disable".


=item B<aac_is>

Sets intensity stereo coding tool usage. By default, it's enabled and will
automatically toggle IS for similar pairs of stereo bands if it's benefitial.
Can be disabled for debugging by setting the value to "disable".


=item B<aac_pns>

Uses perceptual noise substitution to replace low entropy high frequency bands
with imperceivable white noise during the decoding process. By default, it's
enabled, but can be disabled for debugging purposes by using "disable".


=item B<aac_tns>

Enables the use of a multitap FIR filter which spans through the high frequency
bands to hide quantization noise during the encoding process and is reverted
by the decoder. As well as decreasing unpleasant artifacts in the high range
this also reduces the entropy in the high bands and allows for more bits to
be used by the mid-low bands. By default it's enabled but can be disabled for
debugging by setting the option to "disable".


=item B<aac_ltp>

Enables the use of the long term prediction extension which increases coding
efficiency in very low bandwidth situations such as encoding of voice or
solo piano music by extending constant harmonic peaks in bands throughout
frames. This option is implied by profile:a aac_low and is incompatible with
aac_pred. Use in conjunction with B<-ar> to decrease the samplerate.


=item B<aac_pred>

Enables the use of a more traditional style of prediction where the spectral
coefficients transmitted are replaced by the difference of the current
coefficients minus the previous "predicted" coefficients. In theory and sometimes
in practice this can improve quality for low to mid bitrate audio.
This option implies the aac_main profile and is incompatible with aac_ltp.


=item B<profile>

Sets the encoding profile, possible values:


=over 4


=item B<aac_low>

The default, AAC "Low-complexity" profile. Is the most compatible and produces
decent quality.


=item B<mpeg2_aac_low>

Equivalent to C<-profile:a aac_low -aac_pns 0>. PNS was introduced with the
MPEG4 specifications.


=item B<aac_ltp>

Long term prediction profile, is enabled by and will enable the B<aac_ltp>
option. Introduced in MPEG4.


=item B<aac_main>

Main-type prediction profile, is enabled by and will enable the B<aac_pred>
option. Introduced in MPEG2.


=back

If this option is unspecified it is set to B<aac_low>.

=head2 ac3 and ac3_fixed


AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The I<ac3> encoder uses floating-point math, while the I<ac3_fixed>
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The I<ac3_fixed> encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option C<-acodec ac3_fixed> in order to use it.


=head3 AC-3 Metadata


The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

=head4 Audio Production Information

Audio Production Information is optional information describing the mixing
environment.  Either none or both of the fields are written to the bitstream.


=over 4



=item B<-mixing_level> I<number>

Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be
used if the Audio Production Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore,
if the C<room_type> option is not the default value, the C<mixing_level>
option must not be -1.


=item B<-room_type> I<type>

Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing session at
the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a dubbing stage with the
industry standard X-curve equalization; a small room has flat equalization.
This field will not be written to the bitstream if both the C<mixing_level>
option and the C<room_type> option have the default values.

level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.

=head3 Extended Bitstream Information

The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream Syntax as
specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped into 2 parts.
If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the C<center_mixlev>
and C<surround_mixlev> options if it supports the Alternate Bit Stream
Syntax.

=item B<-channel_coupling> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

=head2 libfdk_aac


libfdk-aac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer FDK AAC code from
the Android project.

Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libfdk-aac>. The library is also incompatible with GPL,
so if you allow the use of GPL, you should configure with
C<--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libfdk-aac>.

This encoder is considered to produce output on par or worse at 128kbps to the
B<the native FFmpeg AAC encoder> but can often produce better
sounding audio at identical or lower bitrates and has support for the
AAC-HE profiles.

VBR encoding, enabled through the B<vbr> or B<flags
+qscale> options, is experimental and only works with some
combinations of parameters.

Support for encoding 7.1 audio is only available with libfdk-aac 0.1.3 or
higher.

For more information see the fdk-aac project at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/p/opencore-amr/fdk-aac/>E<gt>.


=head3 Options

Note that VBR is implicitly enabled when the B<vbr> value is
positive.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency. If not specified (or explicitly set to 0) it
will use a value automatically computed by the library. Default value
is 0.

=head2 libshine


Shine Fixed-Point MP3 encoder wrapper.

Shine is a fixed-point MP3 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.

The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/projects/libshine-fxp/>E<gt>. We only support the
updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at E<lt>B<https://github.com/savonet/shine>E<gt>.

libvorbis encoder wrapper.

Requires the presence of the libvorbisenc headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libvorbis>.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libvorbis wrapper. The
B<oggenc>-equivalent of the options are listed in parentheses.

To get a more accurate and extensive documentation of the libvorbis
options, consult the libvorbisenc's and B<oggenc>'s documentations.
See E<lt>B<http://xiph.org/vorbis/>E<gt>,
E<lt>B<http://wiki.xiph.org/Vorbis-tools>E<gt>, and oggenc(1).

=item B<b (>I<-b>B<)>

Set bitrate expressed in bits/s for ABR. B<oggenc> B<-b> is
expressed in kilobits/s.


=item B<q (>I<-q>B<)>

Set constant quality setting for VBR. The value should be a float
number in the range of -1.0 to 10.0. The higher the value, the better
the quality. The default value is B<3.0>.

This option is valid only using the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool.
For library interface users, use B<global_quality>.


=item B<cutoff (>I<--advanced-encode-option lowpass_frequency=N>B<)>

Set cutoff bandwidth in Hz, a value of 0 disables cutoff. B<oggenc>'s
related option is expressed in kHz. The default value is B<0> (cutoff
disabled).


=item B<minrate (>I<-m>B<)>

Set minimum bitrate expressed in bits/s. B<oggenc> B<-m> is
expressed in kilobits/s.


=item B<maxrate (>I<-M>B<)>

=item B<iblock (>I<--advanced-encode-option impulse_noisetune=N>B<)>

Set noise floor bias for impulse blocks. The value is a float number from
-15.0 to 0.0. A negative bias instructs the encoder to pay special attention
to the crispness of transients in the encoded audio. The tradeoff for better
transient response is a higher bitrate.

=head2 libwebp


libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.


=head3 Pixel Format


Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<-lossless> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.


=item B<-compression_level> I<integer>

For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the I<method> option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.


=item B<-qscale> I<float>

For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
I<global_quality> and must be multiplied by I<FF_QP2LAMBDA>.


=item B<-preset> I<type>

Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do not use a preset.

=item B<default>

Use the encoder default.

=item B<picture>

=head2 libx264, libx264rgb


x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libx264>.

libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC
entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the B<x264opts> and B<x264-params>
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 C<x264_param_parse> function.

The x264 project website is at
E<lt>B<http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html>E<gt>.

The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed RGB
pixel formats as input instead of YUV.


=head3 Supported Pixel Formats


x264 supports 8- to 10-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time. FFmpeg only supports one bit depth in one particular
build. In other words, it is not possible to build one FFmpeg with multiple
versions of x264 with different bit depths.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
B<x264>-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.

To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options
and some others requiring special attention are documented here. For
the documentation of the undocumented generic options, see

Set loop filter parameters, in I<alpha>:I<beta> form.


=item B<cplxblur (>I<cplxblur>B<)>

Set fluctuations reduction in QP (before curve compression).


=item B<partitions (>I<partitions>B<)>

Set partitions to consider as a comma-separated list of. Possible

Do not consider any partitions.

=item B<all (>I<all>B<)>

Consider every partition.

=item B<x264opts (N.A.)>

Set any x264 option, see B<x264 --fullhelp> for a list.

Argument is a list of I<key>=I<value> couples separated by
":". In I<filter> and I<psy-rd> options that use ":" as a separator
themselves, use "," instead. They accept it as well since long ago but this
is kept undocumented for some reason.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i foo.mpg -vcodec libx264 -x264opts keyint=123:min-keyint=20 -an out.mkv



=item B<a53cc> I<boolean>

Import closed captions (which must be ATSC compatible format) into output.
Only the mpeg2 and h264 decoders provide these. Default is 1 (on).


=item B<x264-params (N.A.)>

parameters.

This option is functionally the same as the B<x264opts>, but is
duplicated for compatibility with the Libav fork.

=head2 libxvid


Xvid MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl>.

The native C<mpeg4> encoder supports the MPEG-4 Part 2 format, so
users can encode to this format without this library.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libxvid wrapper. Some of
the following options are listed but are not documented, and
correspond to shared codec options. See B<the Codec
Options chapter> for their documentation. The other shared options

=item B<off>

Disable displaying of SSIM information.


=item B<avg>

Output average SSIM at the end of encoding to stdout. The format of
showing the average SSIM is:

	
	Average SSIM: %f


For users who are not familiar with C, %f means a float number, or
a decimal (e.g. 0.939232).

the end of encoding to stdout. The format of per-frame information
is:

	
	       SSIM: avg: %1.3f min: %1.3f max: %1.3f

Apple ProRes encoder.

FFmpeg contains 2 ProRes encoders, the prores-aw and prores-ks encoder.
The used encoder can be chosen with the C<-vcodec> option.

If set to I<auto>, the matrix matching the profile will be picked.
If not set, the matrix providing the highest quality, I<default>, will be
picked.


=item B<bits_per_mb> I<integer>

How many bits to allot for coding one macroblock. Different profiles use
between 200 and 2400 bits per macroblock, the maximum is 8000.


=item B<mbs_per_slice> I<integer>

Number of macroblocks in each slice (1-8); the default value (8)
should be good in almost all situations.


=item B<vendor> I<string>

Override the 4-byte vendor ID.
A custom vendor ID like I<apl0> would claim the stream was produced by
the Apple encoder.


=item B<alpha_bits> I<integer>

Specify number of bits for alpha component.
Possible values are I<0>, I<8> and I<16>.
Use I<0> to disable alpha plane coding.


=back



=head3 Speed considerations


In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher B<bits_per_mb> limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the B<qscale> parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.


=head2 libkvazaar


Kvazaar H.265/HEVC encoder.

Requires the presence of the libkvazaar headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
B<--enable-libkvazaar>.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<b>

Set target video bitrate in bit/s and enable rate control.

=head2 QSV encoders


The family of Intel QuickSync Video encoders (MPEG-2, H.264 and HEVC)

The ratecontrol method is selected as follows:


=over 4


=item *

When B<global_quality> is specified, a quality-based mode is used.
Specifically this means either

=over 4


=item -

I<CQP> - constant quantizer scale, when the B<qscale> codec flag is
also set (the B<-qscale> ffmpeg option).


=item -

I<LA_ICQ> - intelligent constant quality with lookahead, when the
B<look_ahead> option is also set.


=item -

I<ICQ> -- intelligent constant quality otherwise.

=back



=item *

Otherwise, a bitrate-based mode is used. For all of those, you should specify at
least the desired average bitrate with the B<b> option.

=over 4


=item -

I<LA> - VBR with lookahead, when the B<look_ahead> option is specified.


=item -

I<VCM> - video conferencing mode, when the B<vcm> option is set.


=item -

I<CBR> - constant bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified and equal to
the average bitrate.


=item -

I<VBR> - variable bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified, but is higher
than the average bitrate.


=item -

I<AVBR> - average VBR mode, when B<maxrate> is not specified. This mode
is further configured by the B<avbr_accuracy> and
B<avbr_convergence> options.

=back


=back


Note that depending on your system, a different mode than the one you specified
may be selected by the encoder. Set the verbosity level to I<verbose> or
higher to see the actual settings used by the QSV runtime.

Additional libavcodec global options are mapped to MSDK options as follows:


=over 4


=item *

B<g/gop_size> -E<gt> B<GopPicSize>


=item *

B<bf/max_b_frames>+1 -E<gt> B<GopRefDist>


=item *

B<rc_init_occupancy/rc_initial_buffer_occupancy> -E<gt>
B<InitialDelayInKB>


=item *

B<slices> -E<gt> B<NumSlice>


=item *

B<refs> -E<gt> B<NumRefFrame>


=item *

B<b_strategy/b_frame_strategy> -E<gt> B<BRefType>


=item *

B<cgop/CLOSED_GOP> codec flag -E<gt> B<GopOptFlag>


=item *

For the I<CQP> mode, the B<i_qfactor/i_qoffset> and
B<b_qfactor/b_qoffset> set the difference between I<QPP> and I<QPI>,
and I<QPP> and I<QPB> respectively.


=item *

Setting the B<coder> option to the value I<vlc> will make the H.264
encoder use CAVLC instead of CABAC.

=head2 vc2


SMPTE VC-2 (previously BBC Dirac Pro). This codec was primarily aimed at
professional broadcasting but since it supports yuv420, yuv422 and yuv444 at
8 (limited range or full range), 10 or 12 bits, this makes it suitable for
other tasks which require low overhead and low compression (like screen
recording).


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<b>

Sets target video bitrate. Usually that's around 1:6 of the uncompressed
video bitrate (e.g. for 1920x1080 50fps yuv422p10 that's around 400Mbps). Higher
values (close to the uncompressed bitrate) turn on lossless compression mode.


=item B<field_order>

Enables field coding when set (e.g. to tt - top field first) for interlaced
inputs. Should increase compression with interlaced content as it splits the
fields and encodes each separately.


=item B<wavelet_depth>

Sets the total amount of wavelet transforms to apply, between 1 and 5 (default).
Lower values reduce compression and quality. Less capable decoders may not be
able to handle values of B<wavelet_depth> over 3.


=item B<wavelet_type>

Sets the transform type. Currently only I<5_3> (LeGall) and I<9_7>
(Deslauriers-Dubuc)
are implemented, with 9_7 being the one with better compression and thus
is the default.


=item B<slice_width>


=item B<slice_height>

Sets the slice size for each slice. Larger values result in better compression.
For compatibility with other more limited decoders use B<slice_width> of
32 and B<slice_height> of 8.


=item B<tolerance>

Sets the undershoot tolerance of the rate control system in percent. This is
to prevent an expensive search from being run.


=item B<qm>

Sets the quantization matrix preset to use by default or when B<wavelet_depth>
is set to 5

=over 4


=item -

I<default>
Uses the default quantization matrix from the specifications, extended with
values for the fifth level. This provides a good balance between keeping detail
and omitting artifacts.


=item -

I<flat>
Use a completely zeroed out quantization matrix. This increases PSNR but might
reduce perception. Use in bogus benchmarks.


=item -

I<color>
Reduces detail but attempts to preserve color at extremely low bitrates.

=head1 SUBTITLES ENCODERS



=head2 dvdsub


This codec encodes the bitmap subtitle format that is used in DVDs.
Typically they are stored in VOBSUB file pairs (*.idx + *.sub),
and they can also be used in Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<even_rows_fix>

When set to 1, enable a work-around that makes the number of pixel rows
even in all subtitles.  This fixes a problem with some players that
cut off the bottom row if the number is odd.  The work-around just adds
a fully transparent row if needed.  The overhead is low, typically
one byte per subtitle on average.

By default, this work-around is disabled.
