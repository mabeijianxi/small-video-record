   The FFmpeg Project proudly presents FFmpeg 3.2 "Hypatia", about 4
   months after the release of FFmpeg 3.1.

   A complete Changelog is available at the root of the project, and the
   complete Git history on http://source.ffmpeg.org.

   We hope you will like this release as much as we enjoyed working on it, and
   as usual, if you have any questions about it, or any FFmpeg related topic,
   feel free to join us on the #ffmpeg IRC channel (on irc.freenode.net) or ask
   on the mailing-lists.
